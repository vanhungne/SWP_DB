            question: "What's not covered by the warranty?",
            answer: "Intentional damage, cosmetic changes due to normal wear, or damage resulting from improper care or exposure to harsh chemicals are typically not covered. The Standard plan doesn't cover accidental damage or loss. Always refer to your specific warranty terms for full details."

            question: "Can I transfer my warranty to someone else?",
            answer: "Standard and Extended warranties are non-transferable. Lifetime warranties may be transferred once to an immediate family member for a fee of $100 or 10% of the original item value, whichever is greater. The transfer must be done in-store and both parties must be present."
        },
        {
            question: "How do I make a claim?",
            answer: "To make a claim, follow these steps: 1) Gather your original purchase receipt and warranty certificate. 2) Visit any of our stores or call our dedicated warranty hotline. 3) Our staff will guide you through filling out a claim form. 4) We'll assess your item and provide repair options or replacement details within 3-5 business days. 5) Once approved, repairs typically take 7-14 days, while replacements can be immediate if the item is in stock."
        },
        {
            question: "What if my item can't be repaired?",
            answer: "If an item cannot be repaired, we offer the following solutions: 1) Replacement with an identical item if available. 2) Store credit for the current market value of the item, which you can use to select a new piece. 3) For Lifetime warranty holders, we offer the option to upgrade to a higher value item by paying the difference. Our goal is to ensure your complete satisfaction."
